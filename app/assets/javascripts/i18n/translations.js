Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly\nreduce natural gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid\nmanagement companies to reinforce grids.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHybrid heat pumps can intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or\ngas-fired heater) is the most efficient or cost-effective given the\nweather conditions and insulation level.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly\nreduce natural gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid\nmanagement companies to reinforce grids.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHybrid heat pumps can intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or\ngas-fired heater) is the most efficient or cost-effective given the\nweather conditions and insulation level.

Heat pumps reduce your need for gas to heat\nthe house, because it uses electricity to pump the heat. The biggest\ndisadvantage of a heat pump is the high investment costs.","lighting":"Choose the kind of lighting you prefer:\n\n\u003ch4\u003eIncandescent lighting\u003c/h4\u003e\nMany EU countries will ban the incandescent light bulb in the future.\nThey only convert about 2-3% of the energy used into visible light.\nThe rest is radiated as heat.

An advantage\nis that they tend to give off a 'warm' light.\n\n\u003ch4\u003eFluorescent lighting\u003c/h4\u003e\nFluorescent lights produce light by sending an electric charge\nthrough a rarified gas that is contained in a tube. A typical\nfluorescent light converts electricity into visible light 10\ntimes more efficiently than the traditional incandescent lamp still\nused in many homes. The lights are usually also more expensive, but\nthe higher costs are offset by much longer\nlifetimes and lower electricity bills.\n\n\u003ch4\u003eLED lighting\u003c/h4\u003e\nLED lights are 50% more efficient than conventional fluorescent lights.\nUnlike fluorescent lights, LEDs can be frequently switched on and off\nwithout decreasing their lifetime.

The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.

The insulation level can be\nexpressed as a \"thermal resistance\" or R-value. This is a measure of\nhow much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the\nR-value, the better the insulation.\n\nFor the Netherlands, the average R-value of old residences is about 0.5.\nThis is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated\nresidences.
