      The aim of this game is to playfully introduce you to the versatility
      of the energy transition and to challenge your energy and
      climate preferences and corresponding consequences. By moving the sliders,
      you increase or decrease different energy sources, carriers
      (sustainable, fossil, collective and nuclear) or interventions that
      reduce CO2emissions (such as insulation and use of energy-efficient
      equipment and means of transport including fuel-efficient lighting and
      electric cars). Each adjustment affects the balance between the supply
      and demand for energy. For example, the installation of more electric
      heat pumps and the increase in electric transport drives up the demand
      for electricity; windmills, solar panels and power plants, will then
      increase the supply. The game shows the resulting CO2 emissions and costs
      based on your choices or preferences and the reliability of energy supply
      in real time. Of course, the game would not be a game without the ability
      to score points. With wise choices – that is, choices that (in addition
      to the most reliable energy supply) deliver maximum climate gains at the
      lowest cost – you get the most points.<br/><br/>

      Each slider is provided with an explanation. Would you like to know more
      about the energy transition? Then go to morgenland's
      <a href="https://www.morgenlandfilm.nl/index.php">website</a> and watch
      the film, look at the teaching material and much more.<br/><br/>

      You can test your knowledge of the energy issue immediately after playing
      the game by playing the Energy Quiz as an individual or together with
      others. <a href='https://quest.energytransitionmodel.com/'>Click here..</a>
    house: "Create your house of the future"

      The energy transition begins within your house. With this game you can
      build your house of the future. By moving the sliders, you can immediately

      The energy transition begins within your house. With this game you can
      build your house of the future. By moving the sliders, you can immediately
      see the effect of turning the thermostat op or down, not insulating your
      home, or better, opting for an electric heat pump, an HR boiler or hybrid
      system, (de)installing solar panels or leave your roof empty, etc. The
      score of the game is closely related to the sustainability level you
      achieve. More renewable energy means a decrease in CO2 emissions and an
      increase in your points. But beware! Sustainable measures cost money.
      Investment is high and the return on investment is long. It is a matter
      of achieving the optimal level of sustainability within your financial
      limits. You can set a maximum amount, for yourself or for all participants
      involved. In the game you will immediately see what the possibilities are
      within your budget.<br/><br/>

      You can test your knowledge of the energy transition immediately after
      playing the game by playing the Energy Quiz alone or together with others.
