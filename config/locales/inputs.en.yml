  information:
    amount_of_insulation: |-
      Insulation is cheap and effective and strongly influences demand for
      heating or cooling.

      Roof, wall, and floor insulation, and insulating glazing, account for
      75% of the total potential savings. The insulation level can be
      expressed as a "thermal resistance" or Rc-value. This is a measure of
      how much the building resists escaping heat or cold. The higher the
      Rc-value, the better the insulation.

      For the Netherlands, the average Rc-value of old residences is about 1.
      This is the result of a mix between badly, partially, and well-insulated
      residences. For old residences it is not easy to reach Rc-values higher
      than 3.

    comfort_temperature_in_the_house: |-
      Decreasing the setting on your thermostat by a couple of degrees can
      save a lot of energy. Nonetheless, people tend to choose more comfort if
      they can afford it. What is your guess for our future "comfort
      temperature" in the house?

    daily_length_of_shower_per_person: |-
      Almost 80% of daily hot water consumption is for showering. Decreasing
      the length of an average shower (currently 8 minutes) could save a lot
      of water and energy. How long do you think a shower will take in the
      future? Remember that there are 3 people living in this house.

    green_gas_total_share: |-
      Green gas is biogas that has been upgraded to natural gas quality. It
      can be fed into the gas mains. Biogas is conventionally produced by
      bacteria that digest biological material. In the future, such gas may
      be produced by "gasification" of biomass.

    households_area_solar_pv: |-
      Solar cells transform sunlight into electricity. Solar panels are
      installed on rooftops and may compete for space with solar water
      heaters. This technology is developing rapidly and solar panels
      are becoming ever more efficient and cheaper. Solar panels are
      expected to become much cheaper in the coming 40 years.

    households_behavior_standby_killer_turn_off_appliances: |-
      We own more and more electrical appliances that are often left on when
      they are not being used. We can save some power by switching them off.

    households_space_heater_heatpump_ground_water_electricity_share: |-
      A heat pump is like a refrigerator used the other way around: it pumps
      heat into the house from outside, while a refrigerator pumps heat from
      inside to outside. Heat pumps reduce your need for gas to heat the home.
      This seems like a good thing, since gas will not be available forever.

    households_water_heater_solar_thermal_share: |-
      Solar water heaters (SWH) use heat from the sun to produce warm water.
      This warm water can be used for showering or for doing the dishes, etc.
      SWHs are usually installed on rooftops, or in asphalt for parking lots.
      A SWH is often combined with a gas-fired central heating boiler that
      heats water further if necessary. It can also be combined with a heat
      pump.

    households_water_heater_fuel_cell_chp_network_gas_share: |-
      This so-called Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) produces electricity and
      heat from natural gas. Fuel cells are highly efficient.

      The largest disadvantage is that this operates at high temperatures
      (500 - 1000 Â°C), which results in longer start-up times. In households
      this is not a problem as they are typically running constantly,
      producing warm water that is stored in a container until it is needed.
      This device provides more electricity than a typical household needs,
      turning its owner into a net electricity producer.

    households_water_heater_micro_chp_network_gas_share: |-
      The micro-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) unit is a tiny gas-fired
      heat and power plant for use in your house. Using a micro-CHP can
      deliver significant energy savings. Because this technology is
      relatively new, it is quite expensive.

    households_water_heater_solar_thermal_share: |-
      A solar water heater uses heat from the sun to make warm water. This is
      often done on the roof of a house. The hot water can then be used for
      showering or washing dishes. Using the sun's heat saves energy.

    households_insulation_level_old_houses: |-
      A house uses a lot less energy for heating in winter if it is insulated
      and airtight. Insulation prevents heat leaking through windows, walls,
      floors, and ceilings. Airtightness prevents the wind blowing cold air
      into the house and pushing the warm air out. The more airtight a house
      is, the more actively you need to control the inner climate of the
      house. In order to be very energy efficient houses always need to be
      super insulated and airtight.

    households_lighting_led_electricity_share: |-
      Incandescent light bulbs waste a lot of energy. The power they consume
      is mostly turned into heat instead of light. That is why, in Europe, we
      will all shift to low-energy lighting in the coming years. These new
      light bulbs emit the same amount of light and do not become so warm.
      They even last much longer than traditional light bulbs!

    households_solar_pv_solar_radiation_market_penetration: |-
      Solar panels make electricity when they absorb sunlight. This also
      works on cloudy days. As a result, it is easier to predict how much
      power you can expect than with wind power. Of course, a solar
      panel in sunny Spain produces more electricity than one in the United
      Kingdom. You can install solar panels on the roof of your own house
      to avoids power losses from transporting electricity over a long cable. 
      Solar panels are still quite expensive, but they are rapidly becoming
      more affordable.

    number_of_appliances_in_the_house: |-
      The number of household appliances (phones, media players, laptops etc.)
      that we own has been increasing steadily over the past years. Do you
      think this trend will continue in the future? Here you fill in if we
      are going to use more or less appliances. -50% halves the number of
      appliances, 100% doubles it.

    number_of_energy_power_supercritical_coal: |-
      A coal-fired power plant runs at full capacity most of the time.
      Turning it off regularly reduces the amount of electricity that can
      be obtained from an given amount of coal. Coal plants are the most
      polluting of all power production options. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are
      roughly twice that of a gas-fired plant.

    number_of_cold_showers_per_week: |-
      Taking one cold shower a week reduces your hot water consumption by more
      than 10%. How many cold showers would you take per week?

    number_of_energy_power_combined_cycle_network_gas: |-
      A gas-fired power plant is cheaper to build than a coal power plant. 
      However, power from gas costs more than power plants that burn coal. 
      A gas-fired power plant is easily powered up or down. That can come
      in handy when there is no wind and solar panels do not
      produce electricity because the sun is not shining. CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions of a gas-fired power plant are half that of a coal-fired
      power plant.

    number_of_energy_power_ultra_supercritical_network_gas: |-
      A gas-fired power plant is cheaper to build than a coal power plant.

    number_of_households_heating_solar_thermal_collectors: |-
      Solar water heaters (SWH) use heat from the sun to produce warm water. 
      This warm water can be used for showering or for doing the dishes, 
      etc. SWHs are usually installed on rooftops or in asphalt for parking
      lots. A SWH is often combined with a gas-fired central heating boiler
      that heats water further if necessary. It can also be combined with 
      a heat pump.

    number_of_energy_power_nuclear_gen3_uranium_oxide: |-
      A nuclear power plant is very expensive to build. They last
      a really long time and they use only small amounts of fuel (uranium).
      Once the power plant has been built, making electricity is cheap.
      That is why this type of power plant is almost always running. It
      cannot be used to balance the supply and demand of electricity when
      wind- and solar power vary with weather conditions. One advantage is
      that there are almost no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The radioactive
      waste is a disadvantage. No one has come up with a good solution for
      this problem yet. On very rare occasions things can go horribly wrong
      and the plants surroundings become unsuitable for living creatures for
      a very long time. New
      generations of nuclear power plants are designed to be much safer
      than older types.

    number_of_energy_power_ultra_supercritical_coal: |-
      Coal-fired power plants are less suitable to act as backup plants 
      for wind- and solar
      electricity than gas-fired plants, because they are expensive to build and
      cheap to run. For this reason coal-fired power plants are almost always
      running, producing electricity at maximum power. Coal has the highest 
      CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions, about twice a much as gas-fired power plants.
      Wood can be co-fired in coal plants, to reduce such emissions and 
      increase renewability.

    number_of_energy_power_wind_turbine_offshore: |-
      Wind turbines produce renewable power without CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions. Although wind does not run out, it does not always blow. 
      This means that building windmills alone is not enough to ensure 
      supply. 
      You would have a problem if you needed power and there was no wind. 

    number_of_energy_power_wind_turbine_inland: |-
      Wind turbines produce renewable power without CO<sub>2</sub>
      emissions. Although wind does not run out, it does not always blow. 
      This means that building windmills alone is not enough to ensure 
      supply. You would have a problem if you
      needed power and there was no wind.

    transport_car_using_electricity_share: |-
      An electric car uses about half the energy of a diesel or gasoline
      -powered car. Diesel and gasoline are made from oil. By switching to
      electric cars, we will save a lot of oil and at the same time use more
      electricity. Wind or solar powered cars will no longer produce 
      any CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
      Electric cars powered by modern coal or gas-fired power plants  will 
      still emit less than conventional ones.

    use_of_air_conditioning_options: |-
      Currently, less than 30% of redidences in the Netherlands have
      airconditioning. How will this change in the future?
