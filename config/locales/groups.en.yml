        Choose how to heat your house:

        <h4>Gas-fired combi boiler</h4>
        In many homes in the Netherlands, the gas-fired combi-boiler is the
        default technology for producing heat and hot water. Although this
        technology uses gas quite efficiently, it still emits CO<sub>2</sub>.
        This could pose a problem if you want to significantly reduce emissions.

        <h4>Hybrid heatpump</h4>
        This heater is a combination of an electric heat pump that draws its
        heat from the outside air and an efficient conventional gas-fired
        boiler. Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly
        reduce natural gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid
        management companies to reinforce grids.

        Hybrid heat pumps can intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or
        gas-fired heater) is the most efficient or cost-effective given the
        weather conditions and insulation level. Houses with limited insulation
        will rely on the gas-fired part more, better insulated ones will make
        more use of the heat pump.

        <h4>Ground source heat pump</h4>
        A heat pump is like a refrigerator used the other way around: it pumps
        heat into the house from outside, while a refrigerator pumps heat from
        the inside to the outside. Heat pumps reduce your need for gas to heat
        the house, because it uses electricity to pump the heat. The biggest
        disadvantage of a heat pump is the high investment costs.

      lighting: |-
        Choose the kind of lighting you prefer:

        <h4>Incandescent lighting</h4>
        Many EU countries will ban the incandescent light bulb in the future.
        They only convert about 2-3% of the energy used into visible light.
        The rest is radiated as heat. Compared to newer technologies,
        incandescent light bulbs do not live very long. An advantage
        is that they tend to give off a 'warm' light.

        <h4>Fluorescent lighting</h4>
        Fluorescent lights produce light by sending an electric charge
        through a rarified gas that is contained in a tube. A typical
        fluorescent light converts electricity into visible light 10
        times more efficiently than the traditional incandescent lamp still
        used in many homes. The lights are usually also more expensive, but
        the higher costs are offset by much longer
        lifetimes and lower electricity bills.

        <h4>LED lighting</h4>
        LED lights are 50% more efficient than conventional fluorescent lights.
        Unlike fluorescent lights, LEDs can be frequently switched on and off
        without decreasing their lifetime. LED lighting costs 5 to 50 times
        more than fluorescent tubes. Their longer life and lower electricity
        use will, eventually, make the LED light cheaper.

      air_conditioning: |-
        Choose to what extent you want to have air-conditioning for your
        house.

        Air conditioning increases the comfort in your house when it is hot,
        but it also increases electricity demand. Here you can test the impact
        of cooling a single room, or instead add air conditioning to the
        entire home.
