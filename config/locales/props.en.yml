    co2_emissions:
      name: "CO2 Emissions"
      header: "You emit (Q:total_co2_emissions) of CO<sub>2</sub>"
      body: |-
        When fuel is burnt by cars, heaters or power plants, they emit carbon
        dioxide. Scientists assume a big increase in CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions during the last 200 years are responsible for global 
        warming and melting polar ice caps.

        Try to reduce this number to get a higher score, but you cannot get to
        zero, because some emissions (for example from trucks, industry, etc.)
        cannot be influenced with sliders here. (If you want, try to further
        decrease this number in the free professional version of the ETM).

    costs:
      name: "Costs"
      header: "You spend (Q:total_costs) on energy every year!"
      body: |-
        This includes costs for building and installing devices that use
        energy.

    etflex_score:
      name: "Score"
      header: "You score (Q:score) points"
      body: |-
        Your score goes up when you decrease costs, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
        and nuclear waste, and when you increase renewabilty and reliability.
        Relying too much on one technology or option decreases your score.
        A good balance between supply and demand increases it.

    reliability:
      name: "Reliability"
      header:
        'on':  "You have a reliable energy supply!"
        'off': "Oh no! Your current settings will occasionally leave you in the dark."
      body: |-
        Renewable power is less predictable than power from (fossil) power
        plants, because sometimes there is no wind or sunshine. This means you
        cannot be sure to have a reliable supply, unless you manage to store
        it somewhere or have a backup plan.

    renewability:
      header: "(Q:renewability) of your energy is renewable"
      body: |-
        Do you want to produce more renewable energy? Then build more
        wind and solar, or add more green gas to your gas network.

        If you want to increase the number above 20%, you will need to go to
        the free professional version of the ETM in order to adjust settings
        in other sectors, such as transportation and industry.

          In the current situation there are only (Q:number_of_electric_cars)
          electric cars in the Netherlands in 2030. If you want to increase the
          number to more than a million, try to see what percentage of electric
          cars you need.

      body: "The average annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per household depend
        on your choices for heating and electricity. As you add more heating,
        and the house consumes more electricty, emissions will increase."

      header: "Annual electricity use"
      body: "The average household's electricity use depends on your
        assumptions for how many electric appliances will be used, but also on

    gas_use:

        can be higher than 100%. In that case, you have a house that is net

        This score is made up of your performance on all the other dasboard items:

        <li>More investment makes your score go down</li>
        <li>A higher energy bill makes your score go down</li>
        <li>More electricity use makes your score go down</li>
        <li>More gas use makes your score go down</li>

    house:

      body: |-
        The house you see on your screen is an average free-standing Dutch
        house with 3 inhabitants. It has an HR-combi boiler and an average
        number of appliances. The rest is up to you! Can you turn this house
        into an energy self-sufficient house? You can choose from different
        heating options, installing solar panels, and reducing the demand.
