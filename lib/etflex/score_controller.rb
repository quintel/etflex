  #Â Mixes in functionality so that we may disable display of the scenario score
  # by including "score=off", "score=false", or "score=hide" as a query
  # parameter. Any other value will result in the score being displayed.
  #
  # Disabling scores by this mechanism will hide the score "podium" prop, and
  # the high score list.
  #
  # Note that the high score list will never be displayed, regardless of the
  # "score" parameter if the etflex.yml file contains "high_scores: false".
  #
  # Use "before_action :show_hide_scores" to enable the feature on the controller
  # or action.
